# Requirement Analyzer

Welcome to the Requirement Analyzer GUI! This application allows users to upload Excel or CSV files containing requirements and analyze them using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models, specifically a BERT-based model. The tool identifies ambiguous requirements for further processing, and uses NLP tools to find possible candidates resolve anaphora.

## Features

**User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter for uploading files and running models.
**Ambiguity Detection**: Employs a custom BERT-based model to identifies and processes ambiguous requirements separately.
**Automated NLP Analysis**: Uses SpaCy to process text and find possible candidates resolve anaphora.
**CSV Output**: Saves processed results in CSV format for further analysis.

## Installation

### Option 1: EXE Version (Recommended for Easy Setup)

**Download an EXE version with everything built in for a one-click setup.** 

- Note that it may take some time to load up the GUI, so please be patient when using it.
- the file is also fairy large (1.75 GB) as it hold all the libraries and the model built in.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up the project manually or customize the environment, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/requirement-analyzer-gui.git
   cd requirement-analyzer-gui
   ```

Step 1: Set Up the Virtual Environment

On the first run, set up the virtual environment and install the required dependencies by running the following command:
 
   ```bash
   python setup_venv.py
   ```

### What This Script Will Do:

1. Check if a virtual environment is already activated.
2. If not, it will create a new virtual environment in the current directory.

### Step 2: Set the Interpreter to the Virtual Environment

Ensure that your Python interpreter is set to the newly created virtual environment.

### Step 3: Download the Model and Label Encoder

Download the model checkpoint and label encoder and place them in the /model folder. 

- model:

- label encoder:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gxJNMHJannNJzTdJD50nB2oH7RMEDspe/view?usp=sharing

Download en_core_web_sm for the nlp model using the following commands
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Application
After setting up the virtual environment, 
you can run the GUI application:
  ```bash
  python GUI_v3.py
  ```
## Explanation

### setup_venv.py
This script checks if a virtual environment is activated. If not, it creates a new virtual environment in the current directory

### GUI_v3.py
This script provides a GUI for the Requirement Analyzer application. It includes the following functionalities:

  - NLP Model Initialization: Loads the en_core_web_sm model from SpaCy, downloading it if necessary.
  - File Upload: Allows users to upload an Excel or CSV file containing requirements.
  - Model Execution: Processes the uploaded file using a BERT model to identify intents and resolve ambiguous intents.
  - NLP Processing: Uses SpaCy to resolve anaphora in the requirements and saves the results to CSV files.  

    
### BERT_Arch.py
This script defines a custom BERT architecture for the requirement analysis model. It includes:

- A dropout layer for regularization.
- ReLU activation functions.
- Dense layers for transforming the BERT embeddings.
- A softmax activation function for the output layer.
  
### Additional Features

  - NLP Model Initialization: Automatically initializes and downloads the required NLP model if not already installed.
  - File Upload: Supports uploading Excel and CSV files.
  - Requirement Analysis: Processes the requirements and identifies intents using a pre-trained model.
  - Ambiguous Intent Resolution: Resolves ambiguous intents using NLP techniques and saves the results to CSV files.

1. Upload File: Click the "Upload File" button to upload an Excel or CSV file containing the requirements.
2. Run Model: Click the "Run Model" button to process the uploaded file and analyze the requirements.
### Features
  - NLP Model Initialization: Automatically initializes and downloads the required NLP model if not already installed.
  - File Upload: Supports uploading Excel and CSV files.
  - Requirement Analysis: Processes the requirements and identifies intents using a pre-trained model.
  - Ambiguous Intent Resolution: Resolves ambiguous intents using NLP techniques and saves the results to CSV files.

## Model Details
![link for the colab notebook used for the model finetuning](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gaO63M4Sh-k_Pk_lYcP8ygPb0NxqO-Pt?usp=sharing&authuser=1#scrollTo=RpLAUIrPvqDc)

This project uses a custom BERT-based model implemented in PyTorch for intent classification. The model has been fine-tuned on a dataset of requirements to classify them as either "ambiguous" or "unambiguous."
Model Architecture:

  - Pre-trained Model: DistilBERT (distilbert-base-uncased)
  - Custom Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
  - Output Layer: Softmax activation for binary classification.
